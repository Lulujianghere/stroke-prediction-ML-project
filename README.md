# Stroke Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project uses the **Healthcare Stroke Prediction Dataset** to build models that predict the likelihood of stroke based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. (Data sourced from Kaggle: Stroke Prediction Dataset by Fedesoriano. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.)

## Models Used
Three machine learning models were trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

## Required Libraries
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- imbalanced-learn  

Install missing packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
